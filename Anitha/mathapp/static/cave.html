      Valliamman Cave Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Tamil Goddess Sri Valli, Consort of Lord Muruga,situated in the
       northeast corner of Thiruchendur Murugan Temple Complex. In early days, the temple was situated very near to the sea
       shore and now due to the construction of pathways the sea get backed to some extent. The Goddess is residing inside
       a cave of the sandal mountain remainings.
       The Valli cave temple complex consists of a sanctum sanctorum in which Goddess Sri Valli resides. The sanctum 
       sanctorum is situated inside a cave. A narrow path from the Mahamandapam leads to the sanctum sanctorum. The 
       sanctum sanctorum and the paths are situated inside the caves of sandal mountains. In front of the cave, 
       a mandapam with 16 pillars is constructed which is 24.5 feet long and 21.5 feet broad. The main gateway to the
       temple is situated in south facing towards the Thiruchendur Murugan Temple. Inside the cave, paintings and statues 
       of God Muruga and Valli story are present.
