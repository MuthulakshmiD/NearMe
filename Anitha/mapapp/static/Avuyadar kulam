Teppakulam, often referred to as a temple tank, is a traditional South Indian 
water tank built in proximity to temples. One notable example is the Vandiyur
 Mariamman Teppakulam in Madurai. Characterized by its vast size, Teppakulams
  are typically constructed with steps leading down to the water, and they play
   a significant role in religious ceremonies. During the annual Float Festival, 
   the tank is filled with water and adorned with elaborately decorated floats 
   carrying deities. This ritual holds cultural and spiritual importance, drawing 
   devotees who participate in the festivities surrounding the floating procession.
    Beyond its religious significance, Teppakulam also serves
as a tranquil space, providing a serene environment for contemplation and reflection.
